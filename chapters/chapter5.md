
## Chapter 5: Deployment Strategy and Continuous Integration

FountainAI’s deployment strategy revolves around keeping the system lean and flexible, with the **OpenAPI specification** as the single source of truth. This approach eliminates the need for traditional application layers, ensuring that all updates and modifications are handled directly within the OpenAPI spec itself. The deployment process focuses on validating the OpenAPI spec, managing services through **Kong Gateway**, and deploying them in a minimal, scriptable environment.

At the core of this deployment strategy is the concept that **OpenAPI serves as the control layer** for all of FountainAI’s services. Every new endpoint or modification is made through the OpenAPI spec, eliminating the need for embedded business logic. By relying solely on the OpenAPI spec, the risk of bugs is significantly reduced, and the system remains lean and scalable. This also means that the **CI/CD pipeline** is primarily concerned with validating and deploying the OpenAPI spec rather than managing traditional codebases.

To ensure that the OpenAPI spec is accurate and follows best practices, **OpenAPI linting** is a crucial step. Tools like **Spectral** are used to automatically check the spec for issues, ensuring that it remains consistent and valid. By catching problems early in the process, the linting step prevents malformed specs from being deployed into the system, helping to maintain stability.

Once the OpenAPI spec is validated, **Kong Gateway** handles routing and traffic management for the platform’s services. While Kong doesn’t provide native OpenAPI validation like linting tools, it offers important feedback through its **logs**. If an issue arises with the spec, such as misconfigured routes or invalid endpoints, Kong’s logs will highlight these problems. This feedback allows the deployer to refine the spec based on real-world issues that occur when it’s applied to Kong. By analyzing Kong’s logs, the deployer can identify gaps and ensure smooth integration of new services.

The **CI/CD pipeline** for FountainAI is designed with a minimalistic approach:
- **OpenAPI linting** ensures that the spec is well-formed and follows best practices.
- **Kong logs** provide real-time feedback during the deployment process, flagging any issues that arise when Kong processes the OpenAPI spec.
- **Manual workflow triggers** ensure that deployments are only initiated when the deployer is ready, keeping the process controlled and avoiding unnecessary costs.

The deployment itself takes place on **AWS**, using **Docker** running on **EC2 instances** to manage the microservices. By keeping the infrastructure scriptable and minimal, FountainAI can scale and adapt as needed, without introducing unnecessary complexity. **AWS Route 53** is used for **DNS management**, ensuring that the domain names defined in the OpenAPI spec are properly associated with running services. DNS plays a supporting role in linking domain names to the deployed instances, which allows Kong Gateway to route traffic effectively.

The system’s scalability is driven by the flexibility of Docker and the automation provided by Kong Gateway. As traffic increases, additional Docker containers can be deployed to handle the load, and Kong automatically balances the traffic across available instances. This ensures that FountainAI can scale horizontally without needing complex reconfigurations. The deployment remains simple yet powerful, leveraging **Route 53** for DNS and **Kong** for API routing, while keeping OpenAPI at the center of the system’s control.

**Security** is handled directly within the OpenAPI spec. Policies such as **OAuth2** and **API key management** are defined within the spec itself, and Kong Gateway enforces these security measures. By embedding security directly into the API specification, the system ensures that every endpoint is properly secured without requiring separate, complex security layers.

### Use Case

Suppose FountainAI introduces a new **world state descriptor**, such as weather or economic conditions, to influence the narrative. Instead of introducing new application logic, the deployer edits the OpenAPI spec to define a new API endpoint for managing world state changes. This new endpoint is linted to check for errors and best practices before deployment. Once the spec is validated, it is deployed to Kong Gateway. During this process, Kong’s logs provide insights into whether the new endpoint has any issues or misconfigurations. Based on these logs, the deployer can refine the spec and redeploy it as needed, ensuring that the narrative dynamically adjusts based on the new world state descriptor without introducing bugs or requiring changes to underlying code.

In conclusion, the **OpenAPI-first approach** ensures that FountainAI remains lean, scalable, and adaptable. By focusing on the API specification as the control layer, the system avoids the complexity of traditional application layers and reduces the risk of bugs. With **AWS** and **Docker** providing the infrastructure, **Kong** managing traffic, and **Route 53** handling DNS, the deployment process remains minimal, scriptable, and easy to manage. The use of **linting** and **Kong logs** ensures that the system remains stable and ready to handle new features and changes with minimal overhead.

### Appendix 5: Chapter 5 Prompt

**Introduction**:  
Introduce the core concept that the entire FountainAI system is edited and managed through **OpenAPI specifications**. This eliminates the need for a traditional application layer, reducing complexity and minimizing the potential for bugs. Every change to the system is done by editing the OpenAPI spec, which serves as the single source of truth for all services.

**OpenAPI as the Single Source of Truth**:  
Explain how the OpenAPI specification becomes the control layer for FountainAI. Every change, from new endpoints to modifications in data flow, is made by updating the OpenAPI spec. This eliminates the need for embedded business logic, keeping the system lean and avoiding bugs typically associated with code changes.

**OpenAPI Linting**:  
Describe the importance of **linting the OpenAPI spec** to ensure it follows best practices and doesn’t introduce errors. Automated OpenAPI linting ensures the spec remains consistent and valid, catching issues early in the process and ensuring seamless updates.

**Kong Validation of OpenAPI Specs**:  
Explain how Kong Gateway integrates with OpenAPI, and foreshadow how Kong’s error logs will provide feedback for malformed specs. While Kong doesn’t natively validate OpenAPI specs like a linting tool, its **logs** will help identify issues that arise when applying the spec. This prepares the user to handle these logs effectively once Kong is deployed.

**CI/CD Pipeline for OpenAPI Updates**:  
Discuss how the **CI/CD pipeline** integrates OpenAPI linting and Kong logging as key stages. Instead of deploying code, the pipeline focuses on validating the OpenAPI spec:
- **OpenAPI Linting**: Ensures the spec is well-formed and follows best practices.
- **Kong Logs**: When applied, Kong’s logs will identify any issues or missing routes from the OpenAPI spec.
- **Manual Workflow Triggers**: Deployments happen only when manually triggered, providing full control over updates.

**Deploying on AWS**:  
Describe how the system remains **minimal and scriptable** with Docker running on EC2 instances, while highlighting that the core of the system is driven by the OpenAPI spec. Deploying FountainAI becomes a matter of ensuring that the OpenAPI spec is correctly validated and linted before deployment.

**DNS Management with AWS Route 53**:  
Introduce **AWS Route 53** as the tool for managing DNS and ensuring that the services defined in the OpenAPI spec are reachable via valid domains. Explain that Route 53 plays a supporting role by linking domain names to the deployed instances, allowing Kong Gateway to route API traffic properly.

**Scalability and Security Considerations**:  
- **Scalability**: Emphasize that the system can scale horizontally with Docker containers, but core complexity is managed through the OpenAPI spec. Updates don’t require traditional scaling logic, as Kong and Docker handle API scaling automatically.
- **Security**: Mention that API security policies, such as OAuth2 and API key management, are integrated into the OpenAPI spec, and Kong manages their enforcement.

**Use Case**:  
Provide a scenario where a new **world state descriptor** (e.g., weather, economic conditions) is added to FountainAI. The new API endpoint for managing world state changes is defined in the OpenAPI spec. After going through linting and Kong validation (through logs), the updated APIs are deployed without touching traditional application code, allowing the narrative to dynamically adjust based on world state changes. This streamlined approach keeps the system lean and bug-free, ensuring smooth integration of new features.

**Conclusion**:  
Summarize how the **OpenAPI-first approach** eliminates the need for traditional business logic, keeps the system lean, and reduces the risk of bugs. By focusing on OpenAPI linting and logs from Kong, the deployment process becomes efficient and low-maintenance, ensuring that FountainAI remains scalable and adaptable.
